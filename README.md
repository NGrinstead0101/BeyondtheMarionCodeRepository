# BeyondtheMarionCodeRepository

_Beyond the Marion_ is a 3D, adventure game developed in Unity. Myself and about twenty other Bradley University students formed an LLC called Placebo Entertainment and worked on this project over the course of a summer. Our goal was to gain more experience outside the school environment and treat it as a trial run for our capstone project. I was an individual contributor for the project, acting as a Systems and UI Engineer. This repository is a showcase of some of the work that I did on this project.

My primary contributions to the project were a generalized event system, an NPC dialogue system, and the creation of the main and pause menus. The scripts that I wrote for each system can be found in their respective folders. For more information about my process of designing and developing these systems, please check out my portfolio website [linked here](https://sites.google.com/view/nickgrinstead/beyond-the-marion).
